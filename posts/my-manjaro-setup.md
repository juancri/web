So, my [Arch Linux setup](/posts/my-linux-desktop-setup) is broken. Something about Xorg broke so I needed an emergency setup. I installed [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/). Since the system is ready-to-use, I didn't have to install a lot of extra software.

Anyway, I created [this repo](https://github.com/juancri/my-manjaro-setup) to store a few post-installation steps.
