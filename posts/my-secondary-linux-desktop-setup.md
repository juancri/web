Previously, I posted about [my Linux desktop setup](/posts/my-linux-desktop-setup). Arch is great for all my home usage and it's my Linux distro of choice for desktops and laptops, but there're two exceptions: servers and production workstations.

I regularly use my desktop machine to stream video and do other video related work. During the lasts months, though, it has been hard to keep my arch setup stable enough for this kind of work. Since streaming requires a stable environment that is always ready and the tolerance for issues is very low, I decided to install a second Linux distro for this purpose: Ubuntu.

Following my previous post, I created [a GitHub repo](https://github.com/juancri/my-ubuntu-setup) to store a setup script that could help me to configure a new environment when necessary. Of course, this specific script is tailored for my own use cases but I hope it might be useful as inspiration for others as well.
